  1. Context Grounding   - Re-read context, step-back to principles
  2. Analogical Generation - Self-generate relevant examples
  3. Planning            - Explicit analysis plan before execution
  4. Analysis            - Execute plan with evidence grounding
  5. Self-Verification   - Factored verification of claims
  6. Perspective Contrast - Steel-man opposing view
  7. Failure Modes       - Actionable failure analysis
  8. Output Synthesis    - Structured output for parent aggregation
