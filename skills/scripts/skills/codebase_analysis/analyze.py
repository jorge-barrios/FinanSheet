Codebase Analysis Skill - Understanding-focused comprehension workflow.

Four-step workflow:
  1. SCOPE      - Define understanding goals (single pass)
  2. SURVEY     - Initial exploration via Explore agents (single pass)
  3. DEEPEN     - Targeted deep-dives with confidence iteration (1-4 iterations)
  4. SYNTHESIZE - Structured summary output (single pass)

Only DEEPEN iterates based on confidence. Other steps execute once and advance.
