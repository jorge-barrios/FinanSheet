Problem Analysis Skill - Root cause identification workflow.

Five-step workflow:
  1. Gate        - Validate input, establish single testable problem
  2. Hypothesize - Generate testable candidate explanations
  3. Investigate - Iterative evidence gathering (up to 5 iterations)
  4. Formulate   - Synthesize findings into validated root cause
  5. Output      - Produce structured report for downstream consumption

This skill identifies root causes, NOT solutions. It ends when the root cause
is identified with supporting evidence. Solution discovery is downstream.
