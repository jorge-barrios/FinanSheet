Incoherence Detector - Step-based incoherence detection workflow

Usage:
    python3 incoherence.py --step-number 1 --total-steps 21 --thoughts "Analyzing project X"

DETECTION PHASE (Steps 1-12):
    Steps 1-3 (Parent): Survey, dimension selection, exploration dispatch
    Steps 4-7 (Sub-Agent): Broad sweep, coverage check, gap-fill, format findings
    Step 8 (Parent): Synthesis & candidate selection
    Step 9 (Parent): Deep-dive dispatch
    Steps 10-11 (Sub-Agent): Deep-dive exploration and formatting
    Step 12 (Parent): Verdict analysis and grouping

INTERACTIVE RESOLUTION PHASE (Steps 13-15):
    Step 13 (Parent): Prepare resolution batches from groups
    Step 14 (Parent): Present batch via AskUserQuestion
                      - Group batches: ask group question ONLY first
                      - Non-group or MODE=individual: ask per-issue questions
    Step 15 (Parent): Loop controller
                      - If unified chosen: record for all, next batch
                      - If individual chosen: loop to step 14 with MODE=individual
                      - If all batches done: proceed to application

APPLICATION PHASE (Steps 16-21):
    Step 16 (Parent): Analyze targets and select agent types
    Step 17 (Parent): Dispatch current wave of agents
    Steps 18-19 (Sub-Agent): Apply resolution, format result
    Step 20 (Parent): Collect wave results, check for next wave
    Step 21 (Parent): Present final report to user

Resolution is interactive - user answers AskUserQuestion prompts inline.
No manual file editing required.

ABSTRACT DIMENSION CATALOG
==========================

Choose dimensions from this catalog based on Step 1 info sources.

CATEGORY A: SPECIFICATION VS BEHAVIOR
  - README/docs claim X, but code does Y
  - API documentation vs actual API behavior
  - Examples in docs that don't actually work
  Source pairs: Documentation <-> Code implementation

CATEGORY B: INTERFACE CONTRACT INTEGRITY
  - Type definitions vs actual runtime values
  - Schema definitions vs validation behavior
  - Function signatures vs docstrings
  Source pairs: Type/Schema definitions <-> Runtime behavior

CATEGORY C: CROSS-REFERENCE CONSISTENCY
  - Same concept described differently in different docs
  - Numeric constants/limits stated inconsistently
  - Intra-document contradictions
  Source pairs: Document <-> Document

CATEGORY D: TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY (Staleness)
  - Outdated comments referencing removed code
  - TODO/FIXME comments for completed work
  - References to renamed/moved files
  Source pairs: Historical references <-> Current state

CATEGORY E: ERROR HANDLING CONSISTENCY
  - Documented error codes vs actual error responses
  - Exception handling docs vs throw/catch behavior
  Source pairs: Error documentation <-> Error implementation

CATEGORY F: CONFIGURATION & ENVIRONMENT
  - Documented env vars vs actual env var usage
  - Default values in docs vs defaults in code
  Source pairs: Config documentation <-> Config handling code

CATEGORY G: AMBIGUITY & UNDERSPECIFICATION
  - Vague statements that could be interpreted multiple ways
  - Missing thresholds, limits, or parameters
  - Implicit assumptions not stated explicitly
  Detection method: Ask "could two people read this differently?"

CATEGORY H: POLICY & CONVENTION COMPLIANCE
  - Architectural decisions (ADRs) violated by implementation
  - Style guide rules not followed in code
  - "We don't do X" statements violated in codebase
  Source pairs: Policy documents <-> Implementation patterns

CATEGORY I: COMPLETENESS & DOCUMENTATION GAPS
  - Public API endpoints with no documentation
  - Functions/classes with no docstrings
  - Magic values/constants without explanation
  Detection method: Find code constructs, check if docs exist

CATEGORY J: COMPOSITIONAL CONSISTENCY
  - Claims individually valid but jointly impossible
  - Numeric constraints that contradict when combined
  - Configuration values that create impossible states
  - Timing/resource constraints that cannot all be satisfied
  Detection method: Gather related claims, compute implications, check for contradiction
  Example: timeout=30s, retries=10, max_duration=60s → 30×10=300≠60

CATEGORY K: IMPLICIT CONTRACT INTEGRITY
  - Names/identifiers promise behavior the code doesn't deliver
  - Function named validateX() that doesn't actually validate
  - Error messages that misrepresent the actual error
  - Module/package names that don't match contents
  - Log messages that lie about what happened
  Detection method: Parse names semantically, infer promise, compare to behavior
  Note: LLMs are particularly susceptible to being misled by names

CATEGORY L: DANGLING SPECIFICATION REFERENCES
  - Entity A references entity B, but B is never defined anywhere
  - FK references table that has no schema (e.g., api_keys.tenant_id but no tenants table)
  - UI/API mentions endpoints or types that are not specified
  - Schema field references enum or type with no definition
  Detection method:
    1. Extract DEFINED entities (tables, APIs, types, enums) with locations
    2. Extract REFERENCED entities (FKs, type usages, API calls) with locations
    3. Report: referenced but not defined = dangling reference
  Source pairs: Any specification -> Cross-file entity registry
  Note: Distinct from I (code-without-docs). L is SPEC-without-SPEC.

CATEGORY M: INCOMPLETE SPECIFICATION DEFINITIONS
  - Entity is defined but missing components required for implementation
  - Table schema documented but missing fields that other docs reference
  - API endpoint defined but missing request/response schema
  - Proto/schema has fields but lacks types others expect
  Detection method:
    1. For each defined entity, extract CLAIMED components
    2. Cross-reference with EXPECTED components from consuming docs
    3. Report: expected but not claimed = incomplete definition
  Source pairs: Definition document <-> Consumer documents
  Example: rules table shows (id, name, enabled) but API doc expects 'expression' field

SELECTION RULES:
- Select ALL categories relevant to Step 1 info sources
- Typical selection is 5-8 dimensions
- G, H, I, K are especially relevant for LLM-assisted coding
- J requires cross-referencing multiple claims (more expensive)
- L, M are critical for design-phase docs and specs-to-be-implemented
  Select when docs describe systems that need to be built
