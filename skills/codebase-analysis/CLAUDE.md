## Key Point

The script IS the workflow (4 steps: Scope -> Survey -> Deepen -> Synthesize).
Confidence-driven iteration, DEEPEN caps at 4 iterations. Output is facts about structure, patterns, flows, decisions, context.
Do NOT explore or analyze before invoking. Run the script and obey its output.
