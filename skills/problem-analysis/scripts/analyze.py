"""
Problem Analysis Skill - Compact structured reasoning workflow.

Four-phase workflow:
  1. Define   - Problem decomposition + initial solution generation
  2. Explore  - Solution expansion + critique
  3. Verify   - Factored verification (OPEN questions, cross-check)
  4. Synthesize - Trade-off analysis + recommendation

Research grounding:
  - ToT (Yao 2023): decompose into evaluable thoughts
  - CoVe (Dhuliawala 2023): OPEN questions, factored verification (17%->70%)
  - Self-Refine (Madaan 2023): actionable feedback
  - Analogical Prompting (Yasunaga 2024): recall distinct problems

Usage:
    python3 analyze.py --step 1 --total-steps 4
