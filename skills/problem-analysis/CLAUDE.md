## Overview

Structured problem analysis skill. IMMEDIATELY invoke the script - do NOT explore first.

| `SKILL.md`             | Invocation only         | Using the problem-analysis skill |
| `scripts/thinkdeep.py` | Complete workflow logic | Debugging or understanding       |

## Critical Rule

The script IS the workflow. It outputs ACTIONS at each step.
Follow them exactly. Do NOT describe workflow in SKILL.md.

## Phase Summary (6 steps minimum)

1. Decompose - problem, constraints, assumptions
2. Generate - 2-4 distinct solutions
3. Critique - Self-Refine feedback, eliminate/refine
4. Verify - factored verification (extra steps go here)
5. Cross-check - reconcile facts with claims
6. Synthesize - trade-off matrix, decision framework
